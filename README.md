Mining Process Improvement
The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate).

Automobile Dataset Analysis And Recommendation System
Before we buy a car, we need to consider many features of one car, such as the size of the car's engine, the maximum number of seats, the safety factor, the fuel consumption per 100 kilometers, and the price, etc., but for users who have never bought a car or who do not know the car features well, it is very difficult for them to buy a suitable one. Our project is based on this problem and to provide solutions and advices to these kinds of users. We choose these customers who purchase cars for the first time in 4S stores or just search for car information on internet, provide them with the most cost-effective choice. We selected the Car Features dataset from Kaggle. By preprocessing these data, using regression and classification to make a car price prediction model, and then based on our data set and the results of the data processing part to make an online car selection interactive interface for users.
